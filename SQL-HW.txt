USE sakila;
 
#1a. Display the first and last names of all actors from the table `actor`. 
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM actor;

#1b. Display the first and last name of each actor in a single column in upper case letters. Name the column `Actor Name`. 
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ' ,last_name) AS Actor_Name
	FROM actor;

#2a. You need to find the ID number, first name, and last name of an actor, of whom you know only the first name, "Joe." What is one query would you use to obtain this information?
SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name
	FROM actor
	WHERE first_name IN ('Joe'); # CHECK THIS ONE #
 
#2b. Find all actors whose last name contain the letters `GEN`:
SELECT last_name
	FROM actor
	WHERE last_name LIKE '%GEN%';

#2c. Find all actors whose last names contain the letters `LI`. This time, order the rows by last name and first name, in that order:
SELECT last_name, first_name
	FROM actor
	WHERE last_name LIKE '%LI%';

#2d. Using `IN`, display the `country_id` and `country` columns of the following countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and China:
SELECT country_id, country
	FROM country
	WHERE country IN ('Afghanistan', 'Bangladesh', 'China');

#3a. Add a `middle_name` column to the table `actor`. Position it between `first_name` and `last_name`. Hint: you will need to specify the data type.
ALTER TABLE actor
	ADD middle_name VARCHAR(30) AFTER first_name;
	SELECT * FROM actor;
	
#3b. You realize that some of these actors have tremendously long last names. Change the data type of the `middle_name` column to `blobs`.
ALTER TABLE actor
	MODIFY COLUMN middle_name BLOB;
	SELECT * FROM actor;

#3c. Now delete the `middle_name` column.
ALTER TABLE actor
	DROP middle_name;
	SELECT * FROM actor;

#4a. List the last names of actors, as well as how many actors have that last name.
SELECT last_name, count(*) as num FROM actor
	GROUP BY last_name
	ORDER BY count(*) desc;
	
#4b. List last names of actors and the number of actors who have that last name, but only for names that are shared by at least two actors
SELECT last_name, count(*) as num FROM actor
	GROUP BY last_name
	HAVING count(last_name) > 1
	ORDER BY count(*) desc;
 	
#4c. Oh, no! The actor `HARPO WILLIAMS` was accidentally entered in the `actor` table as `GROUCHO WILLIAMS`, the name of Harpo's second cousin's husband's yoga teacher. Write a query to fix the record.
SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name FROM actor
	WHERE last_name = ("Williams") AND first_name = ("Groucho");

UPDATE actor
	SET first_name = ("HARPO")
    WHERE actor_id = 172;
SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name FROM actor
	WHERE actor_id = 172;

#4d. Perhaps we were too hasty in changing `GROUCHO` to `HARPO`. It turns out that `GROUCHO` was the correct name after all! In a single query, if the first name of the actor is currently `HARPO`, change it to `GROUCHO`. Otherwise, change the first name to `MUCHO GROUCHO`, as that is exactly what the actor will be with the grievous error. BE CAREFUL NOT TO CHANGE THE FIRST NAME OF EVERY ACTOR TO `MUCHO GROUCHO`, HOWEVER! (Hint: update the record using a unique identifier.)
UPDATE actor
	SET first_name = ("GROUCHO")
    WHERE actor_id = 172;
    
    -- to make sure I changed Groucho's name correctly:
SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name FROM actor
	WHERE actor_id = 172;
	
    -- to make sure I didn't change every name...
SELECT * FROM actor;

#7a. The music of Queen and Kris Kristofferson have seen an unlikely resurgence. As an unintended consequence, films starting with the letters `K` and `Q` have also soared in popularity. Use subqueries to display the titles of movies starting with the letters `K` and `Q` whose language is English. 
-- FILMS (titles, film_id) > Language (language id)

ORDER BY total_rentals DESC;

#7f. Write a query to display how much business, in dollars, each store brought in. STORE > INVENTORY > RENTAL > PAYMENT
SELECT store_id, sum(amount) AS total_revenue

#8a. In your new role as an executive, you would like to have an easy way of viewing the Top five genres by gross revenue. Use the solution from the problem above to create a view. If you haven't solved 7h, you can substitute another query to create a view.
CREATE VIEW top_genres AS  	
    SELECT name AS genre, sum(amount) AS gross_revenue
	from category
